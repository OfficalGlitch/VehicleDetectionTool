# Vehicle Detection and Tracking using YOLO and SORT

This project demonstrates how to detect and track vehicles in a video stream using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. The combination of deep learning-based object detection and online object tracking techniques accuratly identifies and tracks vehicle movement. 







## Confidence Score Thresholding

The Score-Threshold techqnique was used to make sure that the vehicles being tracked were accurate (>70%).



## Use Case:
**Traffic Optimization:**

Traffic Flow: By tracking the movement of vehicles, Using this system, you can analyze traffic flow and identify congestion points. with this algorithm you have access to the vehicle type, and identity assigned. with this information during congestion a thourough analyzes could be made to identify the reason for the anomaly. The system can determine the percentage of time each lane remains occupied by vehicles, aiding in optimizing signal timings.

_Problem:_ During congestion most vehicles under analysis identfied as "Trucks".

_Solution:_ A HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) Lane has to be built into the highway for trucks inorder to optimize traffic flow.
